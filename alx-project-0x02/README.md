# Next.js Project Setup and Basics

This repository contains the foundational setup for a modern web application using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It serves as a starting point for building scalable and responsive web interfaces with reusable components, routing, and API integration.

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to guide learners through the initial setup of a Next.js application, including configuration of TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. It also introduces best practices for project structure, component design, and code quality.

This setup will be used as the base for further development in the ALX Frontend curriculum.
